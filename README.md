# Recipe Tree

A Recipe Sharing Platform

## Developed by Sean Kish, Rodrigo Villarreal, George Campa, and Diego Barillas-Longoria

# [LIVE DEMO](https://recipe-tree-rdsg.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
Users can visit Recipe Tree to find recipes the community has uploaded. Users can also upload their own recipes for others to see. Recipe details may include the cuisine type, estimated cost to create the dish, ingredients, instructions, and notes from the author.

## Design
The UI for the recipe sharing platform is simple. Each recipe is represented by the name of the recipe and an image of the dish. Click on the dish to see the details.

To add a recipe, click "Add Recipe" at the top of the page. A form will appear. Fill out the appropriate fields and click "Upload files" to add an image of the dish. After the recipe is submitted, it can be seen by other users.

The platform is currently formatted for desktop browser or tablet.
